# Broken Internet

    Ubuntu 18.04 changed to use systemd-resolved to generate /etc/resolv.conf. Now by default it uses a local DNS cache 127.0.0.53. That will not work inside a container, so Docker will default to Google's 8.8.8.8 DNS server, which may break for people behind a firewall.

    /etc/resolv.conf is actually a symlink (ls -l /etc/resolv.conf) which points to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf (127.0.0.53) by default in Ubuntu 18.04.

    Just change the symlink to point to /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf, which lists the real DNS servers:
    sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

    Verify on the host: cat /etc/resolv.conf
